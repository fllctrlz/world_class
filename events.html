    <h2>Meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper</h2>
    <p>On December 4th, 2014, Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited the IBM Laboratories in Markham,
    ON to mark Canada’s achievements as a world leader in science and technology and to announce the
    federal government’s dedication to funding research and innovation in these fields. In attendance
    were Ed Holder, the Minister of State (Science and Technology), Paul Calandra, Parliamentary Secretary
    to the Prime Minister and for Intergovernmental Affairs, Joe Daniel, Member of Parliament for Don Valley East,
    John Carmichael, Member of Parliament for Don Valley West, the Deans from the U15, the top 15 Canadian Research 
    Universities, and the Ctrl-Z Robotics Team.   Ctrl-Z was invited to the event to represent FIRST Robotics Canada
    as well as to model student involvement in innovation and research ventures within the STEM (Science, Technology,
    Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.  Once the Primes Minister finished his announcement, he spent some time with
    Ctrl-Z team members and inquired about their involvement in robotics and their interest in STEM.  Ctrl-Z was 
    especially surprised and excited when Stephen Harper asked them if he could operate one of our robots.
    After meeting with the Prime Minister, ‘sharing’ has taken on a whole new meaning for the team.</p>

	<h2>Toronto Fire Services Open House</h2>
	<p>
	On Saturday, October 4th, 2014, as part of Fire Prevention Week, Ctrl-Z was invited by the District 
	Chief of Public Education to promote FLL at the Toronto Fire Services annual open house 
	with more than 500 attendees. We presented our Nature's Fury research project. 
	Our innovative solution was a self-righting candle holder which help
	prevent fires during natural disasters, like ice-storms. By presenting our robot and project,
	as well as demonstrating the benefits of joining FLL, we impressed many firefighters and the general public.

	<h2>Meeting with Team AEMbots 4573</h2>
	<p>
	On Sunday, November 2nd, 2014, Ctrl-Z assisted Team AEMbots 4573, a rookie team. 
	We invited AEMBots to our school and we shared insight on how they could improve
	their robot and learn new concepts in order to achieve more and take more away from their experience in FLL. 
	It was great to meet and help a fellow team who is as interested in FLL as we are.
	Best of luck to the team.

	<h2>Bayview Glen School Open House</h2>
	<p>
	On Saturday, November 22nd, 2014, Ctrl-Z spent the morning talking about FLL, 
	as well showing our robot and Rhythm Ramp to dozens of guests  at Bayview Glen School’s open house. 
	People were amazed at what we could accomplish as a team. Additionally, approximately 20 attendees of an  
	educational conference visited us. We showed how much we have learned by participating in FLL.

	<h2>Westview Centennial Secondary School Regional FLL Qualifying Tournament</h2>
	<p>
	On Saturday, November 29th, 2014, Ctrl-Z volunteered at the Westview Centennial Secondary School regional qualifier. 
	We served as score keepers, table reset volunteers, and referees. This not only enabled us to gain a better
	understanding of the rules, but also to appreciate the roles of volunteers at our upcoming tournament on December 13th.
	As well, it was another chance to give back to the FLL community that has done so much for us.

	<h2>Demonstrating the Rhythm Ramp to Bayview Glen Middle School students</h2>
	<p>
	On Friday, December 12th, 2014, Ctrl-Z presented their research and innovative solution in front
	of 100 attendees from the Bayview Glen Middle School.  The students were intrigued by our new approach
	to teaching music and couldn't wait to try out the Rhythm Ramp. We were asked interesting questions that showed the strengths of our invention,
	as well as what we still had to improve upon. It was really a great learning experience for both the audience and us.
