		<h2>Ctrl-Z World Class Question<br></h2>
		
		<h4>How we can make learning musical rhythm easier and more fun?<br></h4>
		<br>
	
		<h2>Traditional Approaches to Teaching Rhythm</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		The Eurythmics method of teaching music created by Emile Jaques-Dalcroze in 1905, uses physical movement to teach
		musical structure and rhythm. In 1926, Carl Orff Shulwerk developed a method of teaching music that
		uses the atmosphere like a child’s play world. He said that music is learned by doing, improvisation
		is prevalent, and simpler percussion instruments can be used to make melodies. 
		In 1945, Zoltan Kodaly invented the Kodaly method of teaching music. Under this approch, children are first introduced to 
		concepts through experiences, listening, or movement, such as hand gestures that represent each note. 
		In the 1950’s, Shin’ichi Suzuki created a new way for children to learn music more effectively where they
		are taught at a young age through listening and imitating the song they just heard.
		<br><br>
		At our school, the younger grades are taught rhythm using a single high note, a single low note, and rests. 
		As students reach higher grades, they are introduced to more concepts, such as half notes and
		whole notes, more rests and eventually different note names and pitches.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Introducing Ctrl-Z's Rhythm Ramp!</h2>
		<br>
		<img class="small_img" src="images/project/logo.jpg"></img>
		<img class="small_img" src="images/project/ramp.jpg"></img>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>
		The Rhythm Ramp is a wooden ramp with metal hangers equally spaced apart along its entire length.
		A complete set of chimes covering a full octave is included with the ramp.
		The Rhythm Ramp also comes with <a href="project_articles/book.pdf" target="_blank" 	>a book</a>
		 that guides the students in creating melodies.
		Based on the sheet music, the students attempt to select the appropriate chimes and affix
		them on the desired hangers to create the chosen melody.  Next, the students roll the ball
		down the ramp, hitting the chimes and producing a melody which the students evaluate for 
		correctness based on auditory feedback.  If the students perceive the arrangement as incorrect,
		the students will make adjustments to the chimes and their positions and roll the ball down again
		to re-evaluate their composition.  The students then finally confirm the correctness of the chimes
		and placement by comparing their layout to the solution presented on the following page of the book.
		The rhythms become more complex as the students progress through the book.  This invention will teach
		the students rhythm, pitch recognition and musical notation while still having fun.<br><br> 
		
		We were inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c84C6YZirzE" target="_blank">
		NTT Docomo TV commercial </a>  which features
		a video of a ball rolling down a giant wooden xylophone, producing a song.

		Ode To Joy on the Rhythm Ramp
		</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		The Rhythm Ramp can not only be used as a teaching tool but also as a musical instrument. 
		Team Ctrl-Z decided to have some fun with its invention and arranged the performance of 
		Beethoven's Ode to Joy on the ramp.  Enjoy...

		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Advantages Over Current Solutions</h2>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>The Rhythm Ramp is a physical learning tool that children prefer over virtual, or online tools.</li>
			<li>It combines both visual and auditory techniques to teach rhythm.</li>
			<li>Rolling the ball down the Rhythm Ramp makes the activity seem more like a game to the child.</li>
			<li>The spacing of the chimes provides visual confirmation of the rhythm to the child.</li>
			<li>Multiple children can use the Rhythm Ramp together, providing motivation.</li>
			<li>As an added benefit, children can also learn pitch recognition and music notation 
			using the accompanying instructional booklet.</li>			
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2>Patent Search</h2>
		<br>
		<p>We have conducted a thorough patent search and have found nothing similar
		to the Rhythm Ramp.  We identified a product, the Music Motion Marble Run,
		where the child rolls a ball down a series of stacked blocks to strike various
		tone bars.  However, this product does not teach music, and in particular 
		rhythm, because the ball strikes randomly arranged tone bars, making the
		Music Motion Marble Run more of a toy than a learning tool.  On the other
		hand, the Rhythm Ramp teaches rhythm and music notation.  It does this by 
		using a multimodal approach (a combination of visual, auditory and kinaesthetic)
		which researchers find to be more effective than other approaches that utilize
		single learning modalities.  With the Rhythm Ramp, the students can position the
		chimes on the hangers themselves, see the pattern of the rhythm and hear the pitch
		of the melody they created to form an initial self-assessment of their musical proficiency.
		The auditory feedback provided by the melody, together with a solution diagram provided in 
		the answer booklet, reinforce important music concepts while being fun.</p>

		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Purchasing the Materials</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		Ctrl-Z first went to a local lumber yard to buy door moulding which would be used as the ramp. Then bought
		copper tubing from RONA. We found metal rods at Dollorama.

		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Construction of Rhythm Ramp Prototype</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		We found a website that describes how to make the wind chimes out of copper pipe: 
		<a href="http://leehite.org/Chimes.htm" target="_blank">
		An Engineering Approach to Wind Chime Design and Build</a>.
		On the website there was an Excel spreadsheet entitled <b>All Musical Notes DIY Chime Tube
		Calculator (A=440)</b>
		that contained the information we needed. 
		The pipe we used was half-inch type M copper pipe which has an
		outer diameter of 0.625 inches and an inner diameter of 0.569 inches.  
		We entered these numbers into the Excel spread-sheet to find the required lengths for each note. 
		We chose the octave C6 to C7 because it gave a pleasant sound with reasonable length pipes.
		
		Then, metal wire was cut to the correct lengths and bent at the top to form hangers for the chimes. 
		The metal wire hangers were then inserted into holes we drilled in the ramp.  
		Dental floss was used to hang the chimes with a plastic tube strung through, allowing us 
		to place and remove the chimes from the hangers with ease.

		<h2>Rhythm Ramp Experiment with the Grade Ones</h2>
		
		
		<p>We were invited to perform the following experiment in Ms. Seun's grade 1 music class:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>The children would be split into the groups A and B, each with roughly 10 students.</li>
		<li>Group A's students would first be taught music in a traditional fashion and tested. Then, they would use the Rhythm Ramp and be tested again.</li>
		<li>Group B would undergo the same experience but with a different traditional music education method.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<p> This experiment compares the effectiveness of the Rhythm Ramp compared to 2 different traditional methods.</p>

       </table>
	   
	   <!--<p>
	   In the traditional method, students were given cue cards with either a high note, low note or a rest and they had to replicate 
	   the music that was being played on the iPad.  The grade ones were then given the Rhythm Ramp to execute 
	   the same task except with chimes instead of cards.  The sequence of notes and rests were also changed on the second time.
	   </p>!-->
	   <br>
	   <h5>Student Feedback</h5>
		<br>
	   <ul>
			<li>They thought that ramp was more fun than the cue cards (you don’t shuffle, just stick on the chime)</li>
			<li>They liked the tactile quality i.e. the ball and the wooden ramp</li>
			<li>They liked the fact that they can get auditory feedback right away</li>
			<li>Some of them considered it is an instrument you could play like a piano</li>
			<li>All children preferred the ramp method over the traditional method</li>
			<li>"We thought it was fun!"</li>

		<h2>Rhythm Ramp Experiment with the Grade Fours</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Ctrl-Z conducted an experiment with the Rhythm Ramp on a 20-student 
		grade 4 music class.  These students had a minimum of 5 years of music
		instruction at Bayview Glen School.  Ctrl-Z first randomly selected a 
		first group of 3 students from the class and sent 2 of them to wait 
		outside the room.  The student remaining in the room was instructed 
		to play a short song from the Rhythm Ramp instructional booklet on 
		the xylophone.  As the child played the song, Ctrl-Z recorded the 
		number of times he had to restart, the percentage of correct notes,
		and the elapsed time since he first started.  Once the earlier of: 
		(a) 5 minutes had passed, and (b) the child’s successfully played 
		the song, Ctrl-Z excused the child and retrieved the next child from
		the hallway. The same process was repeated for the remaining 2 students
		initially selected.  Ctrl-Z then selected 3 different students from the 
		class, explained the Rhythm Ramp and asked them to individually use the 
		Rhythm Ramp to create the same melody from the instructional booklet. 
		Ctrl-Z recorded data similar to that collected for each member of the first group of students.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Ctrl-Z found that the 3 students who used the xylophone
		played all the notes correctly but the rhythms were not accurate 
		and it required an average of 50 seconds before they could play 
		the song acceptably.  During those 50 seconds, the students would 
		take approximately 2 to 3 attempts to correctly play the song.
		However, when using the Rhythm Ramp, the 2nd group of 3 students 
		created the song perfectly on just their second attempt in significantly
		less time than 50 seconds.  Interestingly, all 3 students using the Rhythm 
		Ramp appeared to be more engaged and more excited than the first group of 
		3 students and wanted to continue using the Rhythm Ramp following the Ctrl-Z
		experiment to create more songs.  </p>
		<br>
		<p>From this experiment, Ctlr-Z found that the students using the 
		Rhythm Ramp were more engaged, had more fun and were more excited 
		than those who used the xylophone.  As well, Rhythm Ramp students
		enquired about the possibility of using the innovative teaching tool
		in their school music class on a permanent basis.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Rhythm Ramp Applied to a Junior Kindergarten Music Class at Suzuki Music School</h2>
		<br>
		<p>The students used the Rhythm Ramp to play “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” 
		for the entire 45 minute music lesson. Initially, the plan was to use the
		Rhythm Ramp for only the first portion of the class.  However, it was found 
		to be a very engaging approach to teaching and instructor, Orsi Lengyel, felt 
		compelled to use the Rhythm Ramp for the whole class.  Ctrl-Z's observations are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The instructor let the students hang the chimes on the Rhythm Ramp, as well as placed some on herself.</li>
			<li>The Rhythm Ramp was effective at demonstrating the concepts of both rhythm 
			and pitch to the students.  For example, the instructor frequently asked the children which notes were higher, and how much space there was between the notes/hangers.</li>
		
			<li>The Rhythm Ramp was used not only by rolling the metal ball roll down, but also by the instructor tapping each chime with a mallet, like an actual set of chimes that form a melody.  The instructor used the Rhythm Ramp as “two-in-one set”.</li>
		
			<li>Some of the children were very outgoing and some were very shy.  However, by the end of the class even the shy children were comfortable using the Rhythm Ramp.
</li>
	                <li>At the end of the lesson, the instructor had the students put away the chimes, showing that the tool can also help teach discipline.  It is also effective for teaching many different classroom behaviors, such as taking turns and collaborating with other students.
</li>
<li>The instructor was quite pleased and impressed by the Rhythm Ramp’s ability to help children learn in an interactive way.  She also liked how it could be used by both the teacher and the students in a variety of ways.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
