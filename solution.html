		<h2>Ctrl-Z World Class Question<br></h2>
		<br>
		<p>How we can make learning musical rhythm easier and more fun?<br><br></p>
		<h2>Traditional approches to Teaching Rhythm</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		The Eurythmics method of teaching music created by Emile Jaques-Dalcroze in 1905, uses physical movement to teach
		musical structure and rhythm. In 1926, Carl Orff Shulwerk developed a method of teaching music that
		uses the atmosphere like a child’s play world. He said that music is learned by doing, improvisation
		is prevalent, and simpler percussion instruments can be used to make melodies. 
		In 1945, Zoltan Kodaly invented the Kodaly method of teaching music. Under this approch, children are first introduced to 
		concepts through experiences, listening, or movement, such as hand gestures that represent each note. 
		In the 1950’s, Shin’ichi Suzuki created a new way for children to learn music more effectively where they
		are taught at a young age through listening and imitating the song they just heard.
		<br><br>
		At our school, the younger grades are taught rhythm using high notes, low notes, and rests. 
		As students reach higher grades, they are introduced to more concepts, sucha as half notes and
		whole notes, more rests and eventually different note names and pitches.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Introducing Ctrl-Z's Rhythm Ramp!</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		The Rhythm Ramp is a wooden ramp with metal hangers equally spaced apart along its entire length.
		A complete set of chimes covering a full octave is included with the ramp.
		The Rhythm Ramp also comes with a book that guides the students in creating melodies.
		Based on the sheet music, the students attempt to select the appropriate chimes and affix
		them on the desired hangers to create the chosen melody.  Next, the students roll the ball
		down the ramp, hitting the chimes and producing a melody which the students evaluate for 
		correctness based on auditory feedback.  If the students perceive the arrangement as incorrect,
		the students will make adjustments to the chimes and their positions and roll the ball down again
		to re-evaluate their composition.  The students then finally confirm the correctness of the chimes
		and placement by comparing their layout to the solution presented on the following page of the book.
		The rhythms become more complex as the students progress through the book.  This invention will teach
		the students rhythm, pitch recognition and musical notation while still having fun.<br><br> 
		
		We were inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c84C6YZirzE" target="_blank">
		NTT Docomo TV commercial </a>  which features
		a video of a ball rolling down a giant wooden xylophone, producing a song.

		<h2>
		Ode To Joy on the Rhythm Ramp
		</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		The Rhythm Ramp can not only be used as a teaching tool but also as a musical instrument. 
		Team Ctrl-Z decided to have some fun with it's invention and arranged the performance of 
		Beethoven's Ode to Joy on the ramp.  Enjoy...

		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Advantages Over Current Solutions</h2>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>The Rhythm Ramp is a physical learning tool that children prefer over virtual aids.</li>
			<li>It combines both visual and auditory techniques to teach rhythm.</li>
			<li>Rolling the ball down the Rhythm Ramp makes the activity seem more like a game to the child.</li>
			<li>The spacing of the chimes provides visual confirmation of the rhythm to the child.</li>
			<li>Multiple children can use the Rhythm Ramp together, providing motivation.</li>
			<li>As an added benefit, children can also learn pitch recognition and music notation 
			using the accompanying song booklet.</li>			
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Patent Search</h2>
		<br>
		<p>We have conducted a thorough patent search and have found nothing similar
		to the Rhythm Ramp.  We identified a product, the Music Motion Marble Run,
		where the child rolls a ball down a series of stacked blocks to strike various
		tone bars.  However, this product does not teach music, and in particular 
		rhythm, because the ball strikes randomly arranged tone bars, making the
		Music Motion Marble Run more of a toy than a learning tool.  On the other
		hand, the Rhythm Ramp teaches rhythm and music notation.  It does this by 
		using a multimodal approach (a combination of visual, auditory and kinesthetic)
		which researchers find to be more effective than other approaches that utilize
		single learning modalities.  With the Rhythm Ramp, the students can position the
		chimes on the hangers themselves, see the pattern of the rhythm and hear the pitch
		of the melody they created to form an initial self-assessment of their musical proficiency.
		The auditory feedback provided by the melody, together with a solution diagram provided in 
		the answer booklet, reinforce important music concepts while being fun</p>

		<h2>Purchasing the Materials</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		Ctrl-Z first went to a local lumber yard to buy door moulding which would be used as the ramp.

		<h2>Construction of Rhythm Ramp Prototype</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		We found a website that describes how to make the wind chimes out of copper pipe: 
		<a href="http://leehite.org/Chimes.htm" target="_blank">
		An Engineering Approach to Wind Chime Design and Build</a>.
		On the website there was an Excel spreadsheet entitled <b>All Musical Notes DIY Chime Tube
		Calculator (A=440)</b>
		that contained the information we needed. 
		The pipe we used was half-inch type M copper pipe which has an
		outer diameter of 0.625 inches and an inner diameter of 0.569 inches.  
		We entered these numbers into the Excel spread-sheet to find the required lengths for each note. 
		We chose the octave C6 to C7 because it gave a pleasant sound with reasonable length pipes.
		
		Then, metal wire was cut to the correct lengths and bent at the top to form hangers for the chimes. 
		The metal wire hangers were then inserted into holes we drilled in the ramp.  
		Dental floss was used to hang the chimes with a plastic tube strung through, allowing us 
		to place and remove the chimes from the hangers with ease.

		<h2>Experiment #1</h2>
		<br>		
		<h3>Meeting with Grade Ones to Test the Rhythm Ramp</h3>
		<p>We were invited to perform the following experiment in Ms. Seun's grade 1 music class:</p>
		<p>The children would be split into the groups A and B, each with roughly 10 students.</p>
		<p>Group A's students would first be taught music in a traditional fashion and tested. 
		Then, they would use the Rhythm Ramp and be tested again.</p>
		<p>Group B would undergo the same experience but with a different traditional music education method.</p>
		<p> This experiment compares the effectiveness of the Rhythm Ramp compared to 2 different traditional methods.</p>

				sung they lower their hand.</td>
             <td class="tick-border">First, the instructor would sing a simple song without the lyrics.

           </tr>
         </tbody>
       </table>
	   
	   <p>
	   In the traditional method, students were given cue cards with either a high note, low note or a rest and they had to replicate 
	   the music that was being played on the iPad.  The grade ones were then given the Rhythm Ramp to execute 
	   the same task except with chimes instead of cards.  The sequence of notes and rests were also changed on the second time.
	   </p>
	   <br>
	   <h5>Student Feedback</h5>
		<br>
	   <ul>
			<li>They thought that ramp was more fun than the cue cards (you don’t shuffle, just stick on the chime)</li>
			<li>They liked the tactile quality i.e. the ball and the wooden ramp</li>
			<li>They liked the fact that they can get auditory feedback right away</li>
			<li>Some of them considered it is an instrument you could play like a piano</li>
			<li>All children preferred the ramp method over the traditional method</li>
			<li>"We thought it was fun!"</li>
