		<h2>Ctrl-Z World Class Question:<br></h2>
		<p>How we can make learning rhythm easier and more fun?<br><br></p>
		<h2>Traditional Ways of Teaching Rhythm</h2>
		<p>
		The Eurythmics method of teaching music created by Emile Jaques-Dalcroze in 1905 uses physical movement to teach
		musical structure and rhythm. In 1926, Carl Orff Shulwerk came up with a method of teaching music that
		uses the atmosphere like a child’s play world and said that music is learned by doing, improvisation
		is prevalent, and simpler percussion instruments can be used to make melodies. 
		In 1945, Zoltan Kodaly invented the Kodaly method of teaching music. Children are first introduced to 
		concepts through experiences, listening, or movement, such as hand gestures that represent each note. 
		In the 1950’s, Shin’ichi Suzuki created a new way for children to learn music more effectively.
		The children are taught at a young age through listening and imitating the song they just heard.
		<br><br>
		At our school, the younger grades are being taught rhythm with high notes, low notes, and rests. 
		As they reach higher grades, the students are introduced to more concepts, for example half notes and
		whole notes, more rests and eventually different note names and pitches.
		</p>
		<h2>Introducing Ctrl-Z's Rhythm Ramp!</h2>
		<p>
	The Rhythm Ramp is a wooden ramp with metal hangers equally spaced apart along its entire length.  A complete set of chimes covering a full octave is included with the ramp.  The Rhythm Ramp also comes with a book that guides the students in creating melodies.  Based on the sheet music, the students attempt to select the appropriate chimes and affix them on the desired hangers to create the chosen melody.  Next, the students roll the ball down the ramp, hitting the chimes and producing a melody which the students evaluate for correctness based on auditory feedback.  If the students perceive the arrangement as incorrect, the students will make adjustments to the chimes and their positions and roll the ball down again to re-evaluate their composition.  The students then finally confirm the correctness of the chimes and placement by comparing their layout to the solution presented on the following page of the book.  The rhythms become more complex as the students progress through the book.  This invention will teach the students rhythm, pitch recognition and musical notation while still having fun.<br><br> 
		We were inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c84C6YZirzE" target="_blank">
		NTT Docomo TV commercial </a> which features
		a video of a ball rolling down a giant xylophone, producing a song. 
		The Rhythm Ramp has hangers spaced one rhythmic beat apart, on which chimes may be hung.

		<h2>Advantages Over Current Solutions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The Rhythm Ramp is a physical tool that children prefer over virtual aids.</li>
			<li>It combines both visual and auditory techniques to teach rhythm.</li>
			<li>Rolling the ball down the Ramp makes the tool seem more like a game to the child.</li>
			<li>The spacing of the chimes provides visual confirmation of the rhythm to the child.</li>
			<li>Multiple children can use the Ramp together, providing motivation.</li>
			<li>As an added benefit, children can also learn pitch recognition and music notation using the accompanying song booklet..</li>			
			</li>

		<br>
		<h2>Purchasing the Materials</h2>
		<p>
		We first went to a lumber yard to buy door moulding which would be used as the ramp.

		<img class="small_img" src="images/project/buy007.jpg"></img>
		<br>
		<h2>Now Build It</h2>
		<p>
		Then, metal wire was cut to the correct length and bent at the top to form a hook for the chimes. 
		The metal wire hangers were then inserted into holes we drilled in the ramp.  To make the chimes, we cut ¼ inch copper tubes at 
		different lengths to produce the notes from C6-C7.  
		Dental floss was used to hang the chimes and a plastic tube strung through, allowing us to hang and remove the chimes with ease.

		<h2>The Experiment</h2>
		
		<h3>Meeting with Grade Ones to Test the Rhythm Ramp</h3>
		<p>We were invited to perform the following experiment in Ms. Seun's grade 1 music class:</p>
		<p>The children would be split into the groups A and B, each with roughly 10 students.</p>
		<p>Group A's students would first be taught music in a traditional fashion and tested. 
		Then, they would use the Rhythm Ramp and be tested again.</p>
		<p>Group B would undergo the same experience but with a different traditional music education method.</p>
		<p> This experiment compares the effectiveness of the Rhythm Ramp compared to 2 different traditional methods.</p>

           <tr>
             <td class="tick-border">First, the instructor would sing a simple song without the lyrics.
				Then, the students would organize a set of cue cards with notes and rests on them to match the song. 
				Example: ?,rest,?,?</td>
             <td class="tick-border">First, the instructor would sing a simple song without the lyrics.

       </table>

           </tr>
           <tr>
             <td class="tick-border">Teacher sings a pattern of a few notes (e.g. high, high, low, low) where "high" 
				represents a C7 and low represents a C6. Then kids have to mimic the singing with hand gestures. 
				For example, when a high note is sung the kids raise their hand, and when a low note is 
				sung they lower their hand.</td>
             <td class="tick-border">First, the instructor would sing a simple song without the lyrics.
				Then, the students would set up the Rhythm Ramp so it plays back the simple melody.</td>
           </tr>
         </tbody>
       </table>
	   
	   <p>
	   In the traditional method, students were given cue cards with either a high note, low note or a rest and they had to replicate 
	   the music that was being played on the iPad.  The grade ones were then given the Rhythm Ramp to execute 
	   the same task except with chimes instead of cards.  The sequence of notes and rests were also changed on the second time.
	   </p>
	   
	   <h5>Student Feedback</h5>
	
	   <ul>
			<li>They thought that ramp was more fun than the cue cards (you don’t shuffle, just stick on the chime)</li>
			<li>They liked the tactile quality i.e. the ball and the wooden ramp</li>
			<li>They liked the fact that they can get auditory feedback right away</li>
			<li>Some of them considered it is an instrument you could play like a piano</li>
			<li>All children preferred the ramp method over the traditional method</li>
			<li>"We thought it was fun!"</li>

		<h1>What do Studies Say?</h1>
		<p>
		One study tested 4-5 year olds on rhythm and pitch matching. Their results improved when taught using 
		multisensory techniques.  Another study compared 4 different learning modalities: visual, auditory, 
		kinesthetic and multisensory. It tested 210 first, third and fifth graders by demonstrating a rhythm
		using the 4 modalities and then asking them to clap it back.
