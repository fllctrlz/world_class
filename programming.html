    <h1>General Programming Strategy</h1>
	<br>
		<ul>
			<li>We use math blocks, variables, logic,
			compare blocks, loops, switches, and MyBlocks with
			data hubs (so we can reuse code and change 
			parameters, as required)</li>
			
			<li>We have created a selection program
			which allows us to quickly and efficiently 
			choose missions (or even re-run missions 
			quickly) during matches. Audible sounds 
			and meaningful EV3 screen messages allow 
			the user to select programs with ease</li>
			
			<li>By using gear lash removal before each 
			movement, the ramp up feature when starting
			from stationary position, our own 
			error-corrected move block, and Proportional Integral Derivative
			line following we are able to achieve more consistent and repeatable
			robot movement</li>
			
			<li>We regularly use subroutines (i.e. MyBlocks)
			to reuse code whenever possible and to keep
			our program sizes manageable. See diagram of our 
			programming hierarchy which illustrates the extent to which 
			we re-use programming code to be as efficient as possible. 
			</li>
			
			<li>We annotate our work to help us
			debug programs and to better understand
			each programming block's purpose</li>
			
			<li>We make frequent use of our square up 
			subroutine which allows the robot to position 
			itself perpendicularly to any black or green line (from
			virtually any angle of attack)</li>
			
			<li>Our MyBlocks and variables are given 
			descriptive and meaningful names to allow 
			us to easily understand what our programs 
			are doing</li>
			
			<li>Within all of our major movement
			MyBlocks (such as error-corrected move block and PID line following block),
			we have a MyBlock inside that is constantly 
			checking if a certain exit condition is met.
			When that exit condition is met, the program
			immediately exits that loop causing the robot to 
			advance to the next robot maneuver. For example, stop
			the robot when light sensor 4 sees a black
			line.</li>
			
			<li>Our "Check-Abort" MyBlock constantly checks 
			whether the EV3 up arrow button is pressed.   
			The robot operator can interrupt missions at any time and
			still stay within the overall selection program 
			to avoid the need to exit the program and find 
			the next program or mission.</li>
			
			<li>When accelerating from a stationary position,
			our robot uses a Ctrl-Z-designed ramp up feature 
			to minimize the likelihood of wheel slip. 
			This provides for greater repeatability of 
			the robot’s movements.</li>
			
			<li>As well, instead of using standard calibrated
			values, we use raw light sensor values for more
			granularity. Our calibration program collects the
			lowest and highest light readings the robot would 
			see. Then, based on those, we scale any light
			readings to a usable range where 0 is white and 
			1000 is black.</li>
		
		</ul>

		<br>
		<h1>Program Hierarchy</h1>
		<br>
		<p>In the interest of maximizing programming efficiency, we use subroutines 
		(i.e. MyBlocks) whenever possible.  Subroutines are used for typical robot
		movements, like line following, squaring to a line, error-corrected movements,
		etc., as well as for entire missions.  The use of subroutines allows us to re-use
		programming code and enjoy the benefits of an efficient mission selection program. 
		This diagram below illustrates the extent to which Ctrl-Z re-uses programming code.</p>

		<br>
		<br>
		<h1>MyBlock Examples</h1>
		<br>
		<h3>ScaleLight</h3>
		 
		 <p>This ScaleLight MyBlock allows us to read the
		 raw values that a selected light sensor currently
		 sees and either output them directly or use a
		 formula to convert them to a reading in a range from
		0 being white to 1000 being black (based on our
		values for white and black collected in calibration)
		and then output them.
		The equation we created to scale our light readings uses 
		variables for the minimum and maximum raw light readings collected 
		in calibration. Inputting the minimum raw light 
		reading (white) outputs a value of 0, and the maximum raw
		light reading (black) outputs a value of 1000. With 
		these two pairs of coordinates, we identified a linear function.
		When you input the current raw light value the linear function will scale it
		to some point in the range and output a usable calibrated
		value from 0 to 1000.</p>
		
		<p>Returned light reading by the block = 1000*
		(current raw light value – min) / (max – min)</p>
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Proportional Integral Derivative Line Following</h3>
		
		<p>Our Proportional Integral Derivative Line Following
		program is a smoother way to line follow that adjusts
		the power levels of motors B and C proportionally to 
		the distance from the edge of the line, which would
		have a light value of 500. It takes into account the 
		error (the difference between the optimal and current
		light sensor reading), the integral (the sum of all 
		errors), and the derivative (the difference between 
		the current error and last error). Those values are 
		scaled to an appropriate value for use in motor power levels
		based on three user-inputted coefficients in
		InitMain, Kp, Ki, and Kd.</p>
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Main Selection Program</h3>

		<p>This selection program allows us to quickly and 
		efficiently switch programs/missions 
		during the two-and-a half minute match. 
		Our selection program contains MyBlocks, each contains one of our missions.
		The user of the robot simply starts the selection 
		program and clicks the centre button to start the first
		mission. Then, when the mission finishes, the robot 
		automatically advances to the next mission and waits for
		the user to click the centre button to run the appropriate mission.
		In case one needs to go backwards or 
		forwards through the list of missions, the program 
		accommodates that by allowing the user to navigate 
		with the left and right arrow buttons.</p>
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Error-Corrected Move Block</h3>

		<p>For straighter and more accurate movements, 
		our program continuously measures the distances 
		travelled by each drive motor and constantly adjusts their 
		speeds to maintain the predetermined ratio of the 
		distance travelled by motors B and C. This MyBlock also allows for
		more accurate robot arc turns.
		</p>
		
		<img src="images/robot/zmove.jpg"></img>
		<br>
		<h3>Check Abort</h3>
		<br>
		<p>We have created a MyBlock subroutine called 
		Check-Abort that constantly checks whether the up
		arrow button is pressed. If so, Check-Abort exits the loop
		in the MyBlock it is contained in. Our programs are made almost
		exclusively out of MyBlocks, including error-correction, wait blocks, pivot-turns, PID, etc.
		Therefore, in the rare circumstance that we must
		stop our robot, we can do so at any time and still
		stay within our overall selection program,
		rather than fiddle with the EV3 buttons in selecting
		the next mission.</p>
