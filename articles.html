 <h2>Rhythm & Meter - Difficult to Teach? </h2>
 <h4>By Kevin Tuck, as part of an extended study in music education methodology 
 during his Masters of Music degree in 1995</h4>
 <br>
 <ul>
	<li>Rhythm is defined as "The subdivision of a span of time into perceptible sections; the grouping of musical sounds, 
	principally by means of duration and stress."</li>
	<li>Rhythm is put into 3 parts: 1) tempo beats, 2) meter beats and 3) melodic rhythm</li>
	<li>Steady tempo beat is extremely important for students to be able to understand rhythm</li>
	<li>Meter beats - "the division of the tempo beat into two or three"</li>
	<li>Meter beats and tempo beats are essential to melodic rhythm and it is essential in the tonal aspects of music</li>
	<li>Metric accent is maybe most important; helps musicians relate to time signatures and what they mean</li>
	<li>Students learn better with aural and visual help rather than when taught with aural aids and mnemonics alone</li>
	<li>Many rely on: "teaching rhythm first as sound, before any notation is introduced."</li>
	<li>Lois Choksy recommends that teaching rhythm should be done by students imitating rhythm clapped or tapped by the teacher</li>
	<li>Commonly used techniques for teaching rhythm: Counting aloud, Tapping the underlying
	beat, Using the metronome, Clapping or tapping the phrase rhythm, Ensemble experience,
	Conducting, Use of words and mnemonics</li>
	
 </ul>

<h2>Responses to Rhythm Patterns When Presented to Children through Auditory, Visual, and Kinesthetic Modalities </h2>
<h4>By Diane Persellin,  Journal of Research in Music Education 40.4 (1992): 306-315. </h4>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Tested on first, third and fifth graders</li>
	<li>First, children took a pretest to get a control before applying the special teaching methods on rhythmic patterns</li>
	<li>The test was a sheet of paper with various rhythms children had to clap to</li>
	<li>Afterwards, children were either given a visual (notes) of the rhythm, playing (listened to rhythm) 
	of the rhythm, tap on the forearm (kinesthetic) or a combination of each of them</li>
	<li>This would show if they had improved on their rhythmic accuracy</li>
	<li>The results were:</li>

<h2>Effects of Traditional Methods of Rhythm-Reading Instruction </h2>
<h4>By Muriel Bebeau, Journal of Research in Music Education 30.2 (1982): 107-119. Print.</h4>
<br>
<h5>Analysis of rhythm-reading methods</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Orff / Kodaly helps with learning rhythm for younger children</li>
	<li>Traditional method teaches children a steady pulse</li>
	<li>Simplified method teaches children how to say the note </li>
	<li>Another simplified method teaches a speech cue method used in Kodaly which teaches younger 
	children to pair the symbol with the notes</li>
	
</ul>

<h5>Method</h5>
<ul>
	<li>In the speech cue treatment, the information given the children consisted of spoken cues and 
	associated kinesthetic cues</li>
	<li>Tested on third graders out of 78 students in 2 groups</li>
	<li>From each group, 30 students were randomly chosen for comparison of gain scores</li>
	<li>This class was selected because they had not had group instructions in the readin
	g of rhythmic patterns as a part of their school music program</li>
	
</ul>

<h5>Procedures</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Children were permitted to select one of the several methods for playing the pretest</li>
	<li>The children completed all pretests by clapping</li>
</ul>

<h5>Results</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Most pupils in both groups had pretest scores of 0</li>
	<li>There was no significant difference existing between the mean pretest scores for the groups</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Effects of Rote Versus Note Presentations on Rhythm Learning and Retention</h2>
<h5>By Patricia Shehan, Journal of Research in Music Education 35.2 (1987): 117-126. Print.</h5>

<ul>
<li>In the word method, the students got mixed up with the words and syllables</li>
<li>In Orff's method, he used sentences to help remember rhythm </li>
</ul>

<h5>Recognition experienced teacher was involved</h5> 
<ul>
<li>used flashcards, experimenter claps 1 of 3 cards and students have to guess which card is being demonstrated</li>
<li>pretest mean was highest in this category(8.02/20)</li>
<li>post-test mean gain was 2.76 ? (10.78/20)</li>
</ul>
<h5>Dictation experienced teacher was involved</h5> 
<ul>
<li>students used popsicle stick kits consisting of 20 popsicle sticks, </li>
10 half popsicle sticks, 6 dried white navy beans, and 5  2-cm metal rimmed key tags with paper centers</li>
<li>students used the kits and made note configurations on special flashcards</li>
<li>the experimenter played rhythms on a bongo drum for the students to write with popsicle sticks</li>
<li>pretest mean was 0.3/20</li>
<li>post-test mean gain was 1.27 ? (1.3/20)</li>
</ul>
<h5>Performance experienced teacher was involved </h5>
<ul>
<li>measured students’ ability to correctly clap a measure of 4/4 or 6/8</li>
<li>student would clap the rhythm on the flashcard and would be marked right or wrong</li>
<li>pretest mean was 0.5/20</li>
<li>post-test mean gain was 3.03 ? (3.08/20)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Effects of Learning Modalities on Melodic and Rhythmic Retention and on Vocal Pitch-Matching by Preschool Children</h2>
<h5>by Diane Persellin, Perpetual and Motor Skills 78 (1994): 1231-1234. Print.</h5>

<li>Tested children aged 4-5 on rhythm and pitch matching</li>
<li>The children were first given a pretest before having aids to set a control</li>
<li>Then, they were either given a visual, kinesthetic, auditory or multimodal aid to see how their results improved</li>
<li>The results were:</li>   
    <img class="big_img" src="images/project/persellin2.jpg"></img>
<li>The article clearly says, "Teachers should be encouraged to consider learning styles when 
    planning instruction.  When teachers use only the kinesthetic learning modality to the exclusion
	of others, music learning may be impeded."</li>
<li>Supports our Rhythm Ramp invention because it is multimodal.</li>

<h2>Advances in Music Reading Research</h2>
<h4>By Helga Gudmundsdottir, Music Education Research, 12.4 (2010): 331-338. Print</h4>
<br>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<ul>
<li>Fluent music literacy is harder to learn</li>
<li>Many of the children have failed by the ways music teachers are taught and teaching children to read music</li>
<li>Sight singing and music reading abilities are about the same because they both require pitch and rhythm reading</li>
<li>Sight singing is not as efficient for fluency and is not as necessary as music reading</li>
</ul>

<h5>Music reading</h5>
<ul>
<li>Music reading involves 2 distinct skills: reading and mechanical skill</li>
<li>The staff reading notation is a multiple task</li>
<li>Music reading  is a construct process in music</li>
<li>Studies on perception indicate that pitch information and timing information is coded separately</li>
<li>In music reading, it entails the separate process to read pitch and timing</li>
</ul>

<h5>Ability to read music</h5>
<ul>
<li>Most music readers acquired their skill early in life without too much struggle</li>
<li>In a study on music students taking graded exams, there were only low correlations found
 between performance ability and sight reading scores</li>
<li>The correlation was somewhat higher for students taking grade 4 than those taking grade 3 exams</li>
<li>Music reading skills do not necessarily develop in parallel with performance abilities</li>
<li>There is a considerable number of children between those 2 abilities</li>
</ul>

<h5>Difficulties in reading music</h5>
<ul>
<li>With other complex skills, music reading is not very hard to those who have mastered 
the skill as long as the reading material is within the scope of the music readers capacities</li>
<li>Music reading is an automatic process in trained musicians</li>
<li>Music students seem to reach the this level effortlessly should not be much of an interest to music educators</li>
</ul>

<h5>Symptoms of success in music reading</h5>
<ul>
<li>Expert music readers look ahead of the piece they are playing more often than less proficient readers</li>
</ul>

<h5>Music reading and pitch structure</h5>
<ul>
<li>Studies show that children learn better with tonal patterns than with traditional music notation</li>
<li>Learning the general structure was more effective instead of individual pitches</li>
</ul>
