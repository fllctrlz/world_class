	<h2>High-Level Strategy</h2>
	<p>For the last three FLL seasons the team has taken the approach of designing, building and programming two separate robots. 
	The robots each have different features, strengths and weaknesses. While the team strives to create robots which are as repeatable
	as possible, it recognizes that 100% repeatability is unachievable with a single robot given varying robot game table conditions, 
	mat sizes, mat colours and light conditions. The two-robot approach provides the team with a diversified approach which reduces 
	reliance on just one robot. As most tournaments consist of 3 rounds (and perhaps a "for fun" sudden death play-off), the team alternates 
	robots over the course of a tournament. To adhere with the robot game rules, we make sure that only one micro controller is in the robot
	game competition area for any one match.</p>
	

	<br>
	<h2>Design Process</h2>
	<p>When designing our base robot, we establish criteria at the outset, such as desired footprint, height, balance, drivetrain, 
	sensors to be used, user interface, etc. to arrive at a working prototype. We also strive to design and build a base robot which
	is robust and which features a frame around the chassis to provide structural rigidity as well as means to square up against walls 
	and mission models. After creating a working prototype, we design attachments keeping in mind that these attachments need to be 
	easy to install and remove, robust, and both passive and multipurpose whenever possible. From testing the prototype base robot and
	the attachments, we make revisions to our work in order to combine and speed up missions and increase repeatability to achieve
	maximum efficiency. By the end of the season, our attachments will often be in their fifth or sixth iteration.</p>

		<h2>Examples of tests experiments used </h2>
	<h4>Finding the right Light Sensors</h4>	
	<p>When first designing our robot we wanted to make sure that all the light sensors were the same.
	What we mean by that is the light sensors all have a small difference in reading because of manufacturing variabiltys. 
	If you were to put two light sensors on the same line then they would get a small difference in reading. To make sure that 
	all our light sensors had about the same reading we comletley shielded  ten light sensors to eliminate the variable of ambient light\
	the took not of what the reading 
	was for each of the light sensors on black , white, and green. We then found the four light sensors which have the
	closest reading to eachother and used those four light sensors on the robot.

	<br>
	<h4>Making sure the Robot goes straight</h4>
	<p>The move blocks that come with the EV3 software (Move Tank and Move Steering) are very unreliable. 
	Although they do come with a built in error correction program they still cannot move staright. In order to test that 
	we set a designated starting spot for the robot and then we woudl run it for a certain distance until it hit the wall on 
	the other side of teh table. We ran the robot tens of times and found that each time it would end up in a differemt spot on the other
	side of the table. Each time it would be atleast one inch away from the previous run. Then, we made our own error corrected 
	move block (which you can read about in the programming section of the website). We conducted the exact same experiment
	using our new block and found that there was much less error and it would consistantly end up in the same spot.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Robot and General Strategy</h2>
	<p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize points per second (i.e. minimize time in base and try to complete as many missions in as short of a time as possible)
combine missions based on proximity and attachment used (see diagram below)</li>
<li>Use an aiming jig to precisely aim the robot in base</li>
<li>Use reference points on the mat (lines, wall, and mission models)</li>
<li>Not use leave-behind attachments anymore due to the junk penalty</li>
<li>Follow the wall with guide wheels when possible to go straight</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Base Robot</h2>
<p>Our base robot is VERY Robust and compact with a frame for strength
We also have four light sensors, for MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY, with shielding from ambient light 
The robot has sliders to keep the robot steering neutral and has narrow, and hard wheels for more accuracy
in both straight movements and turns.  However, we sacrifice some accuracy due to our large diameter wheels
which amplify the error associated with the rotation sensors.
