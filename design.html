	<h2>Design Process</h2>
	<br>
	<p>When designing our base robot, we establish criteria at the outset, such as desired footprint, height, balance, drivetrain, 
	sensors to be used, user interface, etc. to arrive at a working prototype. We also strive to design and build a base robot which
	is robust and which features a frame around the chassis to provide structural rigidity as well as means to square up against walls 
	and mission models. Before creating a prototype base robot we prepare some high level rudimentry drawings on a flip chart 
	which we use to stimulate discussion amongst team members. Once the team settles on a high level base robot design we use LDD 
	or ML CAD to create a 3D-drawing of the prototype. Doing so allows us to be as officiant as possible with regard to type and quantity 
	of pieces used. Based on the final drawing, we construct our prototype base robot using LEGO pieces/elements. After creating a working
	prototype, we design attachments keeping in mind that these attachments need to be 
	easy to install and remove, robust, and both passive and multipurpose whenever possible. From testing the prototype base robot and
	the attachments, we make revisions to our work in order to combine and speed up missions and increase repeatability to achieve
	maximum efficiency. By the end of the season, our attachments will often be in their fifth or sixth iteration.</p>

		<h2>Examples Robotic Testing Conducted by Ctrl-Z </h2>
	<br>
	<h4>Finding the optimal set of Light Sensors for our Robot</h4>	
	<p>When first designing our robot we wanted to make sure that all the light sensors behaved similarly. 
	The light sensors each return a small differences in readings because of variations in manufacturing. 
	For example, if you were to place two different light sensors on the same black line, each would return different values for light intensity.
	Somtimes the difference may be significant. To make sure that 
	all our light sensors had about the same reading we completely shielded ten light sensors to eliminate the 
	variable of ambient light and recorded the reading
	for each of the light sensors on black, white, and green. We then found the four light sensors which have the
	closest reading to each other and used those four light sensors on the robot.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Making the Robot Drive Straight</h4>
	<p>The green EV3 move blocks (Move Tank and Move Steering) are unreliable. 
	Although they do have a built in PID feature, they still cannot move the robot in a straight line. To test this, 
	we set a designated starting spot for the robot and then we ran it until it hit the wall on 
	the other side of the table. We repeated this dozens of times and found that each time it would end up in a different spot on the other
	side of the table (up to one inch away form the previous run). Each time it would be up to one inch away from the previous run. Then, we made our own error-corrected 
	move block (which you can read about in the programming section of this website). We conducted the same experiment
	using our block and found that there was much less error and it would consistently end up in the same spot.

<h2>Our Base Robot</h2>
<br>

		<img class="small_img" src="images/robot/big2.jpg"></img>
	<br>	
		<p>Our base robot is VERY Robust and compact with a frame for strength.
We also have four light sensors, for MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY, with shielding from ambient light. 
The robot has sliders, which are steering nuetral, and has narrow and hard wheels for more accuracy
in both straight movements and turns.  However, we sacrifice some accuracy due to our large diameter wheels
which amplify the error associated with the drive motor rotation sensors.

             	on to the Project Base Learning Mission Modle. On our attachment, we have a D motor that is used to open the door. The D motor 
             	spins with two felxable tubes attached to it. When the tubes hit the door, it will open. To deliver the loops, we suspend them on a 
             	platform. The Platform is only supported by a one M (LEGO unit) beam. The robot will drive straight with the loops over top of the mission 
             	modle. When the robot moves backwards, the platform realeases from the one M beam and falls straigth down, leaving the loops suspended
             	on the Project based Learning mission modle. The attachment also has a small conpartment for the apprentinceship modle to stay in. When the robot 
             	moves backwards from the loops delivering, it leaves behind the apprentinceship modle.
